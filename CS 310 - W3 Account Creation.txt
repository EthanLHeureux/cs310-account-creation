1.)I In bach you can echo (print) and read on the UI between user and script using variables.
    ex.)    echo "Enter full name (ex: John Doe): "
            read fullname
    cmd "read" writes the users response in the "fullname" variable

2.) I took the name input and lowercased it with then added a (-) where the space is in the name. 
    using cmds:
        username=${fullname,,}      #lowercases all chars.
        username=${username// /-}   # replaces the space char with a (-).
